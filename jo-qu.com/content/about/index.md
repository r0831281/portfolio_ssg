## My Journey

Before switching careers, I worked in professional kitchens. I spent years honing my craft, working as a **sous chef in Dubai**, gaining experience in several **fine dining establishments**, and even in a **Michelin-starred restaurant**. Eventually, I worked my way up to become the **head chef of a small restaurant** ‚Äî a role I loved for its intensity and creativity.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and like many in hospitality, I suddenly had more free time than I was used to. During that unexpected pause, I revisited a long-time passion of mine: **computers and the internet**.

I decided to explore whether tech could be more than a hobby, and enrolled in the **Bachelor‚Äôs program at Thomas More**. Fast-forward to today ‚Äî I‚Äôve fully embraced this new path, and I haven‚Äôt looked back since.

### My Hobbies
- **Gaming** ‚Äì I'm into story-rich games and anything that gets my competitive side going.

- **Guitar** - When I need to clear my mind after a coding session, I like to jam on my guitar. Depending on the mood, I‚Äôll play anything from **Creedence Clearwater Revival** to **Metallica** ‚Äî it's my way of unwinding and getting into a different rhythm.

- **Cooking & Baking** ‚Äì Even though I left the professional kitchen behind, I still love cooking and baking for friends and family. There‚Äôs nothing like sharing a homemade meal or dessert to bring people together.

- **Gardening** ‚Äì I enjoy getting my hands in the dirt and growing my own food. There‚Äôs something incredibly satisfying about harvesting ingredients from the garden and turning them into a fresh meal.

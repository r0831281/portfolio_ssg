# Hi — I'm Jonas Quintiens

I combine hands-on systems administration experience with practical software development to help small businesses and teams build reliable, secure, and maintainable systems. I work as a systems administrator at the <a href="https://mchinfo.be" target="_blank">Medical Center for General Practitioners</a> and run my own software development consultancy focused on web development, security consulting, and system architecture.

You can download my CV here: <a href="/files/CV_Jonas_Quintiens1.pdf" target="_blank">Download CV</a>

## What I do

- Web development: modern, accessible websites and web apps built for performance and maintainability.
- Security & hardening: risk assessments, basic penetration testing, and practical remediation plans.
- Systems & infrastructure: network design, VPNs, virtualization, backups and operational runbooks.
- Architecture & consulting: small-to-medium system design, cloud/on-prem guidance and migration planning.

## How I work

I focus on outcome-driven work: understand the problem, propose a pragmatic solution, and deliver a tested result. I prioritize clear documentation, predictable deployments, and maintainable code so you can operate with confidence after the project ends.

## Skills & tools

- System administration: Linux/Windows servers, virtualization, networking, firewalls, VPNs
- Development: JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, basic backend services
- DevOps & tooling: CI/CD, containerization, monitoring, backups
- Other: security best practices, documentation, client-facing communication

## My contribution

Within this project, I took full responsibility for the back-end, both in terms of architecture and development. I designed and implemented the API, the database, and the integration with external services such as Firebase. I also played a leading role in making decisions regarding the technologies used and the composition of the stack. Additionally, I set up the codebase to be modular and scalable, making it easy to extend and maintain.

Towards the end of the project, I also actively contributed to the front-end development, including solving complex issues, optimizing the user experience, and implementing key functionalities in Angular.

In addition to my technical contributions, I regularly supported the team with knowledge sharing, code reviews, and technical coordination to ensure the quality and progress of the project.

Although the project was a team effort, I took on by far the largest share of the work. My commitment, technical expertise, and coordinating role were decisive for the success and quality of the final result.

## Outcomes
- Fully functional administration system for the Gladiolen festival
- Streamlined processes for volunteer and member management
- Scalable and maintainable codebase for future extensions

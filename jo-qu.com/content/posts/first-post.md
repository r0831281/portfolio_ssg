## Welcome to My First Post

This is an example post created using Hugo. Below are some key points:

### Highlights
- **Fast and Flexible**: Hugo is a static site generator that is both fast and flexible.
- **Markdown Support**: Write your content in Markdown, and Hugo takes care of the rest.
- **Customizable**: Easily create custom themes and layouts.

### Example Code
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, Hugo!")

greet()
```

### Conclusion
Thank you for reading my first post. Stay tuned for more updates!

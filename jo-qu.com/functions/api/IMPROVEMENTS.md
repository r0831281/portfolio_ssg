## New Response Structure

```json
{
  "overallAssessment": {
    "tone": "constructive|neutral|adversarial|hostile",
    "primaryIssues": ["array of main problems"],
    "context": "analysis of communication style",
    "severity": "low|medium|high",
    "generalQuality": "overall discourse quality"
  },
  "identifiedTactics": [
    {
      "tacticName": "specific tactic name",
      "category": "tactic category",
      "explanation": "why this qualifies",
      "exampleFromInput": "exact quote",
      "suggestedResponse": "how to respond",
      "confidenceScore": 0.85,
      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "intent": "likely_intentional|possibly_unintentional|unclear",
      "impact": "effect on discourse"
    }
  ],
  "constructiveFeedback": {
    "strengths": ["positive aspects"],
    "improvements": ["specific suggestions"],
    "alternatives": ["better phrasings"],
    "contextualNotes": ["important context"]
  },
  "summary": "brief overall assessment"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ inputText: "text to analyze" })
});
```

### Advanced Usage with Options
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    inputText: "text to analyze",
    options: {
      includeConfidenceScore: true,
      allowCustomTactics: true,
      contextualAnalysis: true,
      severityAssessment: true
    }
  })
});
```

## Benefits for Users

1. **More Accurate Analysis**: Better prompt engineering reduces false positives
2. **Nuanced Understanding**: Distinguishes between malicious tactics and communication style differences
3. **Actionable Feedback**: Specific suggestions for improvement rather than just criticism
4. **Confidence Levels**: Users can judge reliability of findings
5. **Balanced Assessment**: Highlights both problems and strengths
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Considers different communication styles and contexts
7. **Flexible Responses**: Rich data structure allows for various UI presentations
8. **Better Error Handling**: More reliable service with graceful degradation

## Technical Improvements

1. **Robust JSON Schema**: Detailed response validation
2. **Enhanced Error Processing**: Fallback responses for incomplete API results
3. **Temperature Control**: Lower temperature (0.3) for more consistent analysis
4. **Increased Token Limit**: 8192 tokens for detailed responses
5. **Better Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for rate limiting
6. **Input Validation**: Checks for empty/invalid input text
7. **Response Caching**: Cache-Control headers to prevent stale results

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing clients will receive enhanced data but can ignore new fields
- **Optional Parameters**: New options are optional with sensible defaults
- **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can adopt new features incrementally

This improved version provides much more flexible, nuanced, and actionable analysis while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations.

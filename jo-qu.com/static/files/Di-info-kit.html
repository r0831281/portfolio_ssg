  <h1>Disinfo Defense Kit</h1>
  
  <p>
    The quality of public discourse has been in decline. People are talking more but listening less. Instead of trying to understand each other, conversations are turning into ego contests and social performances. Disingenuous debate tactics aren't just annoying — they're corrosive. They make real discussion impossible, drive polarization, and reward performative nonsense over truth.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is a guide to recognizing and calling out those tactics. If we want better conversations and a healthier society, we need to start by naming the things that make honest dialogue impossible.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Bad-Faith Tactics</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Well Actually</strong>: Correcting irrelevant details to feel smart. Doesn’t engage the point.<br><em>Response:</em> "That doesn’t change the argument I’m making."</li>
    <li><strong>Gish Gallop</strong>: Spamming multiple shallow arguments to overwhelm the conversation.<br><em>Response:</em> "Pick one point and we’ll talk about it properly."</li>
    <li><strong>Whataboutism</strong>: Deflecting by pointing at another issue. Avoids responsibility.<br><em>Response:</em> "We can talk about that after we finish this discussion."</li>
    <li><strong>Straw Man</strong>: Misrepresenting your argument to make it easier to attack.<br><em>Response:</em> "That’s not what I said. Respond to the actual point."</li>
    <li><strong>Mocking or Sarcasm</strong>: Aimed at ego defense, not dialogue.<br><em>Response:</em> "If you have a real point, make it."</li>
    <li><strong>Condescension</strong>: Pretending to educate instead of discuss. Status game.<br><em>Response:</em> "Instead of talking down to me, explain what you disagree with."</li>
    <li><strong>Shifting the Burden of Proof</strong>: Making a claim but expecting others to disprove it.<br><em>Response:</em> "You made the claim — back it up."</li>
    <li><strong>False Equivalence</strong>: Pretending two things are the same when they’re not.<br><em>Response:</em> "That comparison doesn’t hold up."</li>
    <li><strong>Motte and Bailey</strong>: Switching between extreme and safe claims to dodge criticism.<br><em>Response:</em> "Pick one position and defend it."</li>
    <li><strong>Tone Policing</strong>: Dismissing what someone says based on how they say it.<br><em>Response:</em> "The tone doesn’t change the facts."</li>
    <li><strong>Cherry Picking</strong>: Only presenting selective data that supports their side.<br><em>Response:</em> "You’re leaving out important context. Let’s look at the full picture."</li>
    <li><strong>Slippery Slope</strong>: Claiming one step will inevitably lead to an extreme outcome.<br><em>Response:</em> "Let’s focus on what’s actually being proposed, not an imagined chain reaction."</li>
    <li><strong>Appeal to Hypocrisy (Tu quoque)</strong>: Pointing out personal flaws to dodge the argument.<br><em>Response:</em> "My actions don’t invalidate the facts I’m bringing up."</li>
    <li><strong>Red Herring</strong>: Introducing unrelated topics to avoid addressing the current one.<br><em>Response:</em> "That’s a different issue. Let’s stick to the current topic."</li>
    <li><strong>Flooding the Zone</strong>: Overwhelming with noise or quantity to exhaust the other side.<br><em>Response:</em> "You’re not giving time to think, just trying to drown the conversation."</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Spot Biased Reporting and Propaganda</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Loaded Language</strong>: Sensational or emotional words to provoke a reaction rather than inform.<br><em>Tip:</em> Watch for words like “disaster,” “traitor,” “miracle” that indicate opinion or emotion over fact.</li>
    <li><strong>False Balance</strong>: Giving fringe or disproven views equal weight as expert consensus.<br><em>Tip:</em> Just because both sides are shown doesn’t mean both are equally valid.</li>
    <li><strong>Missing Context</strong>: Presenting facts without the background that makes them meaningful.<br><em>Tip:</em> Ask yourself: what’s not being said? What’s being left out?</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Sources Abuse</strong>: Over-reliance on unnamed insiders without corroboration.<br><em>Tip:</em> Be skeptical if every source is vague or unnamed.</li>
    <li><strong>Agenda Framing</strong>: Repeated emphasis on certain topics while ignoring others.<br><em>Tip:</em> Look at what they consistently focus on — and what they ignore.</li>
    <li><strong>Image Manipulation</strong>: Using photos or graphics to create emotion or bias.<br><em>Tip:</em> A photo of a protester yelling doesn’t represent the whole protest.</li>
    <li><strong>Clickbait Titles</strong>: Headlines designed to provoke clicks over accuracy.<br><em>Tip:</em> If the headline feels emotional or exaggerated, read the actual article before reacting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    These tactics don't just frustrate good-faith discussion — they encourage misinformation, tribalism, and intellectual laziness. If you care about truth, clarity, and understanding, it's worth learning to recognize and call these patterns out. Not every disagreement needs to be a debate. But if you're going to engage, engage honestly.
